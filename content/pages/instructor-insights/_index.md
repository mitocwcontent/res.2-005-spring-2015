Workshop Overview
-----------------

This page focuses on the _Girls Who Build: Make Your Own Wearables Workshop_ as it was facilitated by Kristen Railey in December 2014.

The _Make Your Own Wearables_ _Workshop_ introduces high school girls to computer science and electrical and mechanical engineering through wearable technology. This one-day workshop, developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory, consists of hands-on projects in manufacturing and wearable electronics. These include 3D printing jewelry and laser cutting a purse, as well as programming LEDs to light up when walking. Participants learn the design process, 3D computer modeling, and about machine shop tools, in addition to writing code and building a circuit.

Intended Workshop Outcomes
--------------------------

### Workshop Goals for Participants

*   Discover what engineering is
*   Challenge stereotypes about who engineers are and what they do
*   Gain exposure to the design process
*   Explore 3D computer modeling
*   Design a bracelet using [SOLIDWORKS](https://www.solidworks.com/sw/education/student-software-3d-mcad.htm)
*   Code a [FLORA](https://www.adafruit.com/products/659) in Arduino for a wearable circuit with pressure sensor and LEDs
*   Tour a rapid prototyping machine shop

    ### Workshop Sessions
    
    Workshop sessions were held at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The workshop space was large enough to accommodate icebreaker activities. Participants also had access to laptops equipped with the software needed to code in Arduino.
    
*   ![Twenty girls stand near a wooden table. Several items printed with a 3D printer lay on the table. A scientist stands behind the table and gestures toward the items.]({{< resource_file 082c2a77-e938-74a1-6c2c-4fcc2ff93864 >}})

### Typical Student Background

In December 2014, participants were girls in grades 9-12. About half of them came to the workshop with previous programming experience. Many of the girls did not have experience with computer-aided design or 3D printing.
