Overview
--------

Students are introduced to the design process of engineering, from ideation to design to rapid prototyping. To begin, a keynote speaker from the wearable technology industry discusses the process through an example; in this case, prosthetics for the developing world. Then, the students learn computer aided design (CAD) by creating a bracelet in Solidworks. Bonus problems are included exploring the many features in CAD. Following the creation of a bracelet in CAD the students are brought to a machine shop to see their designs being 3D printed. In the machine shop, students are shown the range of additive and subtractive manufacturing tools.
